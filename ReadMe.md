<h2> Set up GitHub </h2>
**Use Case** : The error indicates that GitHub no longer supports password authentication for HTTPS. You need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password. Follow these steps to resolve the issue: 
**Use the PAT for Authentication**:
1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Go to your GitHub account settings.
   - Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens".
   - Click on "Generate new token".
   - Select the scopes you need (e.g., `repo` for full control of private repositories).
   - Generate the token and copy it.

2. Update Your Git Remote URL
   Replace your password with the PAT when pushing to the repository. You can update the remote URL to include the token:
   - git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@<repourl>
